# axure-prototypes

Here contains a series of prototypes made with axure with an equivalent html folder.

Prototypes that which never got to user testing are located in [extra folder](https://github.com/office-for-students/alpha-prototypes-axure/tree/develop/axure-prototypes/extra).

To run and view each prototype, run the following command in terminal:
`open <prototype location>/home.html`
for example:
`open lab1-17th-dec/cardwall-html-v1/home.html`
